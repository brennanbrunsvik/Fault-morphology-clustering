IMPORTANT: This repository is currently ONLY ready for the review processes. Before others can use it, we must sort out where the seismic catalog will be stored as it does not belong to us. This will be solved by the time the paper can be published.

This repository contains the supplementary code and Jupyter Notebook for the paper "Three-Dimensional Fault Morphology Obtained from Unsupervised Machine Learning of Clusters of Aftershocks." The Jupyter Notebook combines the paper and code to improve transparency and allow the reader to run their own tests. The code can be ran interactively using Binder cloud computing by clicking on the below image. Then, navigate through the "Supplementary_Jupyter_Notebook" folder and open "Supplementary_Notebook.ipynb".

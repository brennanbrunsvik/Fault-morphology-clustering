This repository contains the supplementary code and Jupyter Notebook for the paper "Three-Dimensional Fault Morphology Obtained from Unsupervised Machine Learning of Clusters of Aftershocks." The Jupyter Notebook combines the paper and code to improve transparency and allow the reader to run their own tests. The code can be ran interactively using Binder cloud computing by clicking on the below image. Then, navigate through the "Supplementary_Jupyter_Notebook" folder and open "Supplementary_Notebook.ipynb".
